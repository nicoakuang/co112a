Project 3
The computer's main memory, also called Random Access Memory, or RAM, is an addressable
sequence of registers, each designed to hold an n-bit value. In this project you will gradually build a
RAM unit. This involves two main issues: (i) using gate logic to store bits persistently, over time,
and (ii) using gate logic to locate ("address") the memory register on which we wish to operate.
Objective
Build the following chips:
DFF (given)
Bit
Register
RAM8
RAM64
RAM512
RAM4K
RAM16K
PC

If the load is 1, the input will be processed in DFF, and the subsequent output will be equal to the input. Otherwise, the output value will remain unchanged.
